The California Golden Bears football program represents the University of California, Berkeley, in college football as a member of the Pac-12 Conference
The Cal football team plays its home games at California Memorial Stadium and is coached by Justin Wilcox.
Since beginning of play in 1886, the Cal football team has won five NCAA recognized national titles - 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1937. And 14 conference championships, last one in 2006.
The Cal football team has produced two of the oddest and most memorable plays in college football: Roy "Wrong Way" Riegels' fumble recovery at the 1929 Rose Bowl and The Play kickoff return in the 1982 Big Game.
University of California fielded its first American Football team in 1886. In March of 1892, the school played its first game against Stanford University. This was the first instance of the annual rivalry match - The Big Game, one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.
1923 saw the opening of the California Memorial Stadium, which sat more than 73,000; several thousand more could watch the games from Tightwad Hill right above it.
In 1947 former Northwestern coach Lynn "Pappy" Waldorf become the new head coach of Cal. During his first season the Bears went 9-1, with their only loss coming from conference champs - USC. Known as "Pappy's Boys", the Cal teams of 1947-1950 won 33 consecutive regular season games, earning three PCC championships and three Rose Bowl berths.
California began a renaissance under Jeff Tedford who became head coach in 2002. Under him the Golden Bears posted eight consecutive winning seasons, a feat that had not been accomplished since the days of Pappy Waldorf.
Led by future NFL superstar Aaron Rodgers, the 2004 Bears posted a 10-1 regular season record. Their only loss came against the eventual national champion - USC, the team finished the regular season ranked No. 4 in the nation.
In 2018, the Cal Bears went 7-6 with Wilcox's defense being ranked No. 15 in the nation in total yards allowed. The highlight of the season was defeating USC for the first time since 2003, when Wilcox was the Cal linebackers coach.
Memorial Stadium was built to honor Berkeley alumni, students, and other Californians who died in World War I and modeled after the Colosseum in Rome. It has been named one of the top college football stadiums by various publications, and it is also listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
The Cal Memorial Stadium is located on the Hayward Fault, which passes directly under the playing field, nearly from goal post to goal post. A 1998 seismic safety study on the California campus gave the stadium a "poor" rating (meaning that the building represents an "appreciable life hazard" in an earthquake). The renovation started in the summer of 2010 and was completed by the beginning of the 2012 season.
California's main rival is Stanford. The two schools participate in the Big Game every year, with the winner taking home the Stanford Axe.
The 2019 California Golden Bears football team are led by third-year head coach Justin Wilcox and play their home games at California Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, California. They will compete as members of the North Division of the Pac-12 Conference.
In 2018, the Bears went 7-6 under second-year head coach Justin Wilcox. The Bears upset #15 Washington 12-10 and defeated USC 15-14 at the Coliseum in Los Angeles to snap a 14-year losing streak to the Trojans.
